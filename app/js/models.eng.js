And it is – the maximum noise isolation and exceptional clarity for musical compositions reproduction. We created this model for fans of “smooth” neutral sound, with “slightly” forses lows. Excellent choice for people who are just starting to get acquainted with the technology of in-ear monitoring and sound drivers of Balanced Armature type!  </p>',

    description: '<p>Medium frequencies without “overload” on the high and low frequencies.Individual AM2-VocalEdition custom monitors are miniature two-way speaker system in your ear. With the additional massive driver for low frequencies and the small, “fast” driver for medium and high frequencies, AM2-VocalEdition monitors create a “clear” and “tight” low range and articulatory high range, which is impossible to achieve by a single driver! AM2-VocalEdition has a slightly forced speech range that appeals to fans of instrumental “analytical” musical styles. Ideal for vocal control (especially female), acoustic guitar and bow instruments!</p>',

    description: '<p>Correct Reference! The sound of AM3-ReferenceEdition custom monitors is without any embellishment . Ambient Acoustics Lab. created this model as the maximum linear in all frequency range! It lacks a excessive monitor “sibilance” and the music bass pumping. It is achieved by using three drivers in each ear! Channels separation is realized by either an electric or acoustic crossover. This allowed to balance and smooth a frequency response more precisely for the requirements of the most sophisticated listener. First of all the model will be interesting for musicians, sound directors, audiophiles who need monitor, accurate sound</p>',

    description: '<p>Universal monitoring!Individual AM4-MusicEdition custom monitors have a musical sound sugnature with deep low frequency dominance in the overall sound picture. The main idea of this model designing was to create a feeling of “physicality” and “voluminosity” while listening to music with rich low frequency components. However, there are no bass “smearing” and “boominess” in the AM4 -MusicEdition, and thanks to a well-balanced work another two drivers, medium and high frequency ranges bring the necessary clarity and lightness in the overall sound picture that so appreciated by lovers of quality music. Sound lightness is achieved by compliance in the resulting frequency response the resonance phenomena of human ear in the free sound field.</p>',

This allowed us to achieve stunning density, depth, and the most importantly – natural reproduction of infralow and low frequencies (dynamic driver) and not lose detail, clarity and airiness inherent for Balanced Armature drivers! AM4-Hybrid monitors perfectly convey the “liveliness” atmosphere of drums, bass guitars and other musical instruments and bass parties sounding. Therefore, these monitors will be interesting for drummers first of all, bass guitarists and fans of “drive”, “involving” performances of musical compositions.</p>',

These custom in-ear monitors are implemented all our many years experience of individual monitoring tools designing! AM6-HiRez individual monitors have six balanced armature drivers that reproduce the entire audible range of human hearing, from infralow to ultra high frequency components. Due to this issue monitors provide music scene much broader and deeper than any other monitors of the laboratory. Audiophiles will duly appreciate this model as AM6-HiRez beeping can be described as a musical one, with the most expressed effect of “physical” presence.</p>',

Due to full anatomical fit for your ear canal, maximum noise isolation is reached, as well as maximum fixing of the individual monitor in an ear. This reduces the working volume levels of the listened composition that reduces the risk of acoustic trauma in noisy environments!Due to the location of speakers closer to the eardrum, it is possible to achieve a clearer bass and increase the subjective loudness of earphones. Also this kind of custom prevails over individual stage monitors!</p>',
